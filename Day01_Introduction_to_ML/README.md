# Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

## Why Machine Learning is Important?
- Automates decision making
- Used in real-world applications like Google Search, Netflix, YouTube, and self-driving cars
- Helps in prediction and pattern recognition

## Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning – Uses labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning – Uses unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning – Learns using rewards and penalties

## Real World Examples
- Email spam detection
- Movie recommendation systems
- Face recognition systems
